  Introducing: Discord Previewer! The live-preview text editor styled in fashioned Discord theme! This application follows Discord's Markdown styling and uses Discord UI design to make it very similar to desktop client of Discord application. The code is written in pure JS, using only <a href="https://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a> framework to handle the backend side of the application. Application's development slowed down once I started working at its successor, <a href="https://github.com/Sevelar/DisViewer/">DisViewer.</a>

This project is a first phase of a larger project, focusing on creating a live-preview DC Markdown text editor, styled by Discord theme and DC Markdown styling. This project will receive its final updates in near future, focusing on bug-fixing, maintaining decent security measures and eventually closing the first phase of the Markdown Text Editor project.
